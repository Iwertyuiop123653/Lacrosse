        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. It is the oldest organized sport in North America, with its origins in indigenous Canada as early as
            the 17th century. The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.
            Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment:
            field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear:
            helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads.The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.The only protective gear required
            for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.
            The modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations.The organization
            hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men
            and women.Each is held every four years.Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908.It was also held as a demonstration event at the 
            1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics.</h3>
            <h2>How to play & rules</h2>
            <iframe width="1340" height="700" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W03VtWxOM_M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <ul>
                <li>Lacrosse is played on a field measuring 110 yards in length by 60 yards in width, with goals at either end measuring six feet by six feet. 
                    The goal is surrounded by a circular “crease” with a diameter of 18 feet. A player may not score from within said crease. The pitch is dissected by the midfield line.</li>
                <li>The game duration is split into four quarters, each of 20 minutes. Team time-outs may be called by either side, during which the game time will be paused.</li>
                <li>Each player carries a stick or “crosse”, with up to four carrying a long stick (52-72 inches) and the rest carrying a short stick (40-42 inches).
                </li>
                <li>Players who make infringements such as being offside or holding an opponent – are punished by being sent to the penalty box for a period of time, usually 30 seconds or one minute.</li>
                <li>Games are started (and restarted after stoppages for goals and at the start of each quarter) with a face-off. During a face-off a player from each side lays their stick horizontally next to the ball until the official blows their whistle, at which point the players battle for possession of the ball.</li>
                <li>Once a team gains possession of the ball they must ensure the ball is progressed beyond the midfield line within 20 seconds to encourage a fast-flowing game.</li>
            </ul>
